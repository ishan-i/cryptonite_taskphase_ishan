hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IHPmz83GBB-u8p4is5ciOAA7rds.dFTN1QDLxkzM1czW}

Process: Changed the directory to '/challenge' and used './run' to launch run, this we did to ensure we don't accidentally executute programs.
